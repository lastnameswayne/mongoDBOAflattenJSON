# mongoDBOAflattenJSON

## Introduction

This is my submission for the MongoDB OA in Javascript. I spent a little under an hour on this in total.

## How to use

You can call my code with

```
cat example.json | node mongoDBOA.js
```

after cloning/downloading my code. example.JSON can be any json file. I have added some sample JSON-files for testing purposes. I used code for reading JSON files from stdin from this github gist: https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/5065599 but my solution at the bottom of the file is of course my own work!

I hope you like it!
